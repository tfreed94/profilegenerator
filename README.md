## Description: 
For this project, I was tasked with creating a Team Profile Generator that would create an HTML file from the command line. When the generator is initiated, the generator will prompt the user a series of questions. It will first ask what is the name of the user's team. After the user have typed in their response, it will ask the user to add in a manager. After that, it will ask the user if they would like to add anymore team members. It will prompt the user to choose between an "engineer", an "intern" or it will prompt the user if they are done and if the team is completed. If the engineer or intern are selected, the user will be prompt to answer more questions. When the user is done adding their team members and have chosen to complete their team, an HTML file will be created. The information the user inputted into the command line will be transferred over to the HTML file. When the HTML file is opened, it will display that team's name at the top. Then, it will list each team member below. It will list their name, role, id and email. If they are a manager, it will list their office number. If they are an engineer, it will list their GitHub page. If they are an intern, it will list the school that they are attending.
